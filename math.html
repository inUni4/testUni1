    <p class="topics">*Quadratic equation</p>
    <p class="topics">Any equation that can be written in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is said to be a quadratic equation</p>
    <p class="topics">*A quadratic equation has the highest degree of 2 ie x^2</p>
    <p class="topics">*The roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 are the values of x which satisfy the equation ie which will make the equation true</p>
    <p class="topics">One of the roots of the equation x^2 + x - 6 = 0 is 2 because (2)^2 + (2) - 6 = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">We use 3 methods to find the roots of a quadratic equation (to define factors)</p>
    <p class="topics">1 Factors</p>
    <p class="topics">a) write the equation in standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 (take all terms to the same side) </p>
    <p class="topics">*It is very important to write 0 alone on one side.</p>
    <p class="topics">As such x^2 = -3x- 2 => x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0</p> 
    <p class="topics">b) Factorise</p>
    <p class="topics">*Find factors that when they add up they can give you the last term but when you multiply them they can give you the second term</p>
    <p class="topics">As such x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">(x + 2)(x + 1) = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">x * x = x^2</p>
    <p class="topics">x * 1 = x</p>
    <p class="topics">2 * x = 2x</p>
    <p class="topics">2 * 1 = 2</p>
    <p class="topics">c) If the product of two factors is equal to zero, one or the other, or both of the factors must be equal to zero.</p>
    <p class="topics">Eg</p>
    <p class="topics">If p * q = 0 then</p>
    <p class="topics">p = 0 or q = 0 or p = q = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">Example 01</p>
    <p class="topics">Determine the roots of</p>
    <p class="topics">2x^2 - 5x = -3</p>
    <p class="topics">2x^2 -5x + 3 = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">(2x - 3)(x - 1) = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">2x * x = 2x^2</p>
    <p class="topics">2x * -1 = -2x</p>
    <p class="topics">-3 * x = -3x</p>
    <p class="topics">-3 * -1 = 3</p>
    <p class="topics">X is equal to 3/2 or 1</p>
    <p class="topics">Example 2</p>
    <p class="topics">Solve for x</p>
    <p class="topics">x + 2 = (3)/(2x - 1)</p>
    <p class="topics">(x + 2)(2x - 1) = (3)/(2x - 1) (2x-1)</p>
    <p class="topics">2x^2 - x + 4x - 2 = 3</p>
    <p class="topics">2x^2 + 3x -2 - 3 = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">2x^2 + 3x -5 = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">(2x + 5)(x - 1) = 0</p>
    <p class="topics">2x * x = 2x</p>
    <p class="topics">2x * -1 = -2x</p>
    <p class="topics">5 * x = 5x</p>
    <p class="topics">5 * - 1 = -5</p>
    <p class="topics">x is equal to -5/2 or 1</p>
    <p class="top">Completing the square</p>
    <p class="topics">We only use this method is we are specifically requested to do so, or if the question says "Determine without using a formula and the expression on left hand side cannot be factorized.</p>
    <p class="topics">Steps</p>
    <p class="topics">1 Write all terms containing x on the left hand side and the constant term on the right hand side.</p>
    <p class="topics">2 Divide by the coefficient of x^2. </p>
    <p class="topics">3 Add (1/2 coefficient of x^2) to both sides.</p>
    <p class="topics">4 Factorise the left hand side which is now a perfect square and add the terms on the right hand side.</p>
    <p class="topics">5 Take the square root on both sides (remember to take +</p>
