      <h1>1. Life at molecular, cellular and tissue level</h1>
      <p>Before studying nucleic acids, it is very important to revise the structure of a typical cell so that you know what a cytoplasm is, what ribosomes are and where they are found and how the nucleus is made up.</p>
      <h2>1.1 DNA: the code of life</h2>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p class="question-bold">What are nucleic acids?</p>
        <p class="answer-to-question"><a class="question-boldd">Nucleic Acids</a> have been called the 'molecules of life' or the 'most extraordinary molecules on Earth', as they have the capacity to <a class="question-boldd">store the information</a> that controls cellular activity and the:</p>
        <li>specialisation of cells to form tissues</li>
        <li>arrangement of tissues into organs.</li>
        <p>This enables organisms to perform all the functions necessary to carry out the basic processes of life, ie movement, nutrition, respiration, excretion, growth, reproduction and responding to stimuli.</p>
        <p>They do this by <a class="question-boldd">controlling the synthesis of proteins</a>. Making proteins may seem far cry from controlling the activities of cells and their deveopment, but it is the first step in that direction. Proteins not only make up much of the structure of the body but, as <a class="question-boldd">enzymes</a> are proteins, they also control the <a class="question-boldd">chemical processes</a> inside cells.</p>
        <p>In this way nucleic acids ultimately control the structure and functioning of all living organisms.The two nucleic acids found in cells are:</p>
        <p class="question-boldd">1. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</p>
        <p class="question-boldd">2. Ribonucleic acid (RNA)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <h1>1. Deoxyribonucleic acid - DNA</h1>
        <p>DNA's discovery has been called the most important biological work of the last 100 years, and the field of genetics may be the scientific frontier for the next 100 years.</p>
        <p class="question-bold">Where is DNA found?</p>
        <p>DNA is <a class="question-boldd">mainly found in the nucleus</a> of a cell where it forms an important part of the <a class="question-boldd">chromosomes</a> that make up the <a class="question-boldd">chromatin network</a>.</p>
        <p>Chromatin = chromosomal material made up of DNA, RNA and histone proteins as found in a non-dividing cell.</p>
        <p class="question-bold">What is extracellular DNA?</p>
        <p>Small amounts of DNA are found outside the nucleus in <a class="question-boldd">mitochondria</a> in plants and animals and in <a class="question-boldd">chloroplasts</a> in plants. This is called <a class="question-boldd">extranuclear DNA</a>.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <p class="bold-text">Chromosomes and genes</p>
          <p class="question-bold">What are chromosomes?</p>
          <p>Chromosomes were discovered by chance in 1888. They absorb dye very easily which is why they were called chromosomes - coloured bodies. This makes them visible under microscope but they can only be seen as individual threads when a cell is dividing.</p>
          <p><a class="question-boldd">Chromosomes</a> are long, thin, interwined thread-like structures made up of a strand of DNA wound around <a class="question-boldd">proteins</a> called <a class="question-boldd">histones</a>.</p>
          <p>Some histones are attached to the DNA and help it to coil up during cell division.</p>
          <p>The DNA molecule is coiled so that these long structures can fit inside the nucleus.</p>
          <p>There are nearly two metres of DNA squeezed into each human cell.</p>

          <p class="question-boldd">A section of a chromosome</p>
          <p>In a body (somatic) cells chromosomes occur in <a class="question-boldd">homologous pairs</a>.</p>
          <p>The chromosomes of a homologous pair are the same size and shape and have the same genes in the same place.</p>
